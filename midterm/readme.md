#Midterm Ideas

For my midterm, I have two ideas using the Arduino UNO kit and some extra sensors:

##IDEA 1: Anosmic Alert :nose::warning:
As you already know, there are blind people, depth people, but there's also Anosmic people, like me! This means I can't smell at all... Yes, anything! It's good when you never had that sense, as David Eaglemen says in his TED talk is all about your "umwelt" ([Here is the TEDTalk] (https://www.ted.com/talks/david_eagleman_can_we_create_new_senses_for_humans) in case you want to understand what I'm talking about!)

To create a electronic "Nose" you first need to understand the sense of smell, here is a pdf with useful info: [The Smell Report by Kate Fox] (https://github.com/linaangel/PhComp_repo/blob/master/midterm/smell.pdf). Also, here is a link to smell disorders: [Smell Disorders] (https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/smell-disorders)

With this challenge to "create" something, I thought it was very useful to have an "Anosmic Alert", I know there are some e-noses and other projects similar, but nothing with those main odors that you need to smell to be alerted and avoid danger. Here is what I've learn from the experience, I really found important to know:

* When the food is rotten 
* When there's an scape of gas (In Colombia some people uses natural gas for the stove and to heat the water in the shower)
* When something is burning
* When your niece is a baby, and you're supposed to babysitt her, and you can't smell the diapers to know if she Pee or Poop:poop:.

My idea is having a device that activates a sound alarm, turns On different colors LEDs when some of these things happends. For each one of these I think the following sensors can help:

###Smoke, Gas or Poop :poop::

##IDEA 2: Allergy :warning:
Again, trying to contribute a little bit and with the experiences I had, I've known so many people suffering from migraines in my live, that I realized after tests and tests that food or environment agents can give you a hard time, and you don't even realize the cause. 

I went to Five different neurologists until I realized I didn't have to get use to a pill to control my headache and nausea. Once I had a bad episode of migraine with blindness and neck tightness, my Internist requested an IeG test ([Diagnostic Allergy Testing](http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/2068676-overview)). Well, I realized I was allergic to Rice :rice:, Orange :tangerine:, Peanut butter, Dust mites and pollen. Once I started to avoid any of that, migranes were stories from the past.

The point is, that it will be very useful to create a device that alerts you when there are this allergens where you are, so you can use a mask, or avoid the place!

###Dust Sensor:
